## Overview

1.Despite the relentless horror caused only by a look at life, naked on the pages of social networks and personal blogs, it is still necessary to write posts on unknown topics, if only in the name of the ongoing personal struggle of each person with the anxieties that haunt him daily and drive him into imaginary frames, becoming cramped and uncomfortable after such a ridiculous amount of time that the mere fact of how long people can live under the yoke of their fear is amazing. But a different choice promises consequences that are incomparable with the minutes spent trying to squeeze lines devoid of meaning from oneself. And therefore, the past week will be filled with futile efforts to fashion at least something worthy of a fraction of the recognition of society through persistent study and development in areas far from the main field of activity, but necessary for modern man. And bouts of graphomania, of course. I have absolutely no idea what you can write in the posts.
