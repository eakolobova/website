title: The white-framed square was already a form of non-objective sensation.
subtitle: Белые поля это не поля, обрамляющие черный квадрат, но только ощущение пустыни, ощущение небытия, в котором вид квадратообразной формы является первым беспредметным элементом ощущения

## Overview

  The night is a slaughterhouse where my veins are opened in the hellfire of exorcism. From the meat hook, I sing a song about life, swept by dark meteors, sacrificed in the name of the destruction of the human family. Love is a head swarming with the whistle of amputees swarming in the ghoul zone, its mouth the edges of a prolapsed womb spewing the fruit of murder, banshee tendrils quivering, grains of rotten sand, shuddering stumps, milk sour green under spells of hate, urethritis stalactites and dysentery - the crucible of reptilian dolls.
    Socialism is a system of civilized co-operators with the monstrous Rasputin at the head, which is copied and photographed not only by large groups of collective propagandists and agitators, but also by collective organizers, differing in their place in the historical system of using airplanes against the needs and disasters of low-flying cavalry, which is dying , is rotting, but is just as inexhaustible as we are to reorganize the Rabkrin.
